music21.trecento.tonality

These functions show how music21 can be used to analyze whether the idea
of tonal closure applies in the music of the Italian fourteenth century
by seeing how often the first note of the tenor (or the given voice stream
number) and the last note of that same voice are the same note.

The script also demonstrates the PNG generating abilities of the software, 
etc.

Note that when the tests are run they just check that the program does not
crash -- the numbers are not checked because the underlying data is changing
too often.

    '''
    The TonalityCounter object takes a list of Trecento Works
    (defined in music21.trecento.cadencebook) and when run()
    is called, stores a set of information about the cadence
    tonalities of the works.

    streamNumber can be 0 (cantus), 1 (tenor, default), or 2
    (contratenor), or very rarely 3 (fourth voice).
    
    cadenceName can be "A" or "B" (which by default uses the
    second ending of cadence B if there are two endings) or
    an integer specifying which cadence to consult (-1 being
    the last one coded.  Useful for sacred music where we
    want the Amen no matter how many internal cadences there
    are).
    
    This example takes three ballata and how that all three of
    them cadence on a different note than they began on.  All
    three cadence on D despite beginning on C, A, and B (or B
    flat) repsectively.
