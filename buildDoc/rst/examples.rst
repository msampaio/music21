Examples and Demonstrations
=============================


The following examples provide a few samples of some of the possibilities available when working with music21.



Creating a Reduction and Labeling Intervals
---------------------------------------------------------

This example, after parsing a polyphonic work stored as an Opus and creating a Score, presents and labels the intervals of the resultant chords of all distinct harmonies::

    from music21 import corpus
    # Parse an Opus, a collection of Scores
    o = corpus.parseWork('josquin/laDeplorationDeLaMorteDeJohannesOckeghem')
    # Create a Score from a Measure range
    sExcerpt = o.mergeScores().measures(127, 134)
    # Create a reduction of Chords
    reduction = sExcerpt.chordify()
    # Iterate over the Chords and prepare presentation
    for c in reduction.flat.getElementsByClass('Chord'):
        c.closedPosition(forceOctave=4, inPlace=True)
        c.removeRedundantPitches(inPlace=True)
        c.annotateIntervals()
    # Add the reduction and display the results
    sExcerpt.insert(0, reduction)
    sExcerpt.show()

Searching a Large Collection of Works for Ultimate Chord Quality
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This example search the entire collection of Bach Chorales stored in the corpus for works that, while in a minor key, end on a minor triad (as opposed to with the more common raised Picardy third)::

    from music21 import corpus, converter, chord
    # Create storage for the results
    results = stream.Stream()
    # Get file paths to all Chorales
    for fp in corpus.bachChorales: 
        # Parse, and then analyze the key
        chorale = converter.parse(fp)
        key, mode = chorale.analyze('key')[:2]
        # Select minor-mode chorales
        if mode == 'minor':
            # Gather last pitches from all parts into a Chord
            lastChordPitches = []
            for part in chorale.parts:
                lastChordPitches.append(part.flat.pitches[-1])
            cLast = chord.Chord(lastChordPitches)
            cLast.duration.type = "whole"
            cLast.transpose("P8", inPlace=True)
            # If a minor triad, append to results with annotations
            if cLast.isMinorTriad() or cLast.isIncompleteMinorTriad():
                cLast.lyric = chorale.metadata.title
                m = stream.Measure()
                m.keySignature = chorale.flat.getElementsByClass(
                  'KeySignature')[0]
                m.append(cLast)
                results.append(m.makeAccidentals(inPlace=True))
    results.show()

Searching the Corpus by Locale
---------------------------------------------------------

This example searches all works in the corpus from two regions in China for the count and percentage of melodic sevenths. These works come from the Essen Folksong database, indexed and stored in the music21 corpus::


    from music21 import corpus, analysis, converter
    # Get an analysis tool
    mid = analysis.discrete.MelodicIntervalDiversity()
    results = []
    # Iterate over two regions
    for region in ['shanxi', 'fujian']:
        # Create storage units
        intervalDict = {}
        workCount = 0
        intervalCount = 0
        seventhCount = 0
        # Perform a location search on the corpus and iterate over 
        # resulting file name and work number
        for fp, n in corpus.search(region, 'locale'):
            workCount += 1
            # Parse the work and create a dictionary of intervals
            s = converter.parse(fp, number=n)
            intervalDict = mid.countMelodicIntervals(s, found=intervalDict)
        # Iterate through all intervals, and count totals and sevenths
        for label in intervalDict.keys():
            intervalCount += intervalDict[label][1] 
            if label in ['m7', 'M7']:
                seventhCount += intervalDict[label][1]
        # Calculate a percentage and store results
        pcentSevenths = round((seventhCount / float(intervalCount) * 100), 
                        4)
        results.append((region, pcentSevenths, intervalCount, workCount))

    # Print results
    for region, pcentSevenths, intervalCount, workCount in results: 
        print('locale: %s: found %s percent melodic sevenths, out of %s intervals in %s works' % (
        region, pcentSevenths, intervalCount, workCount))


*locale: shanxi: found 3.1994 percent melodic sevenths, out of 4282 intervals in 77 works*

*locale: fujian: found 0.7654 percent melodic sevenths, out of 2613 intervals in 53 works*





Finding Chords by Root and Collecting their Successors
---------------------------------------------------------

This example creates a chordal reduction of a polyphonic work and then searches for all Chords that have a specific root. This chord, along with its successor, is then collected and displayed::


    from music21 import corpus, stream, note
    
    # Parse a work from the corpus
    s = corpus.parseWork('bwv66.6')    
    # Reduce the work to a series of simultaneities, then extract only
    # the resultant Chords
    chords = s.chordify().getElementsByClass('Chord')
    # Create a Stream for display
    display = stream.Stream()
    # Iterate through the chords by index and a Chord
    for i, c1 in enumerate(chords):
        # Get the next Chord, or a Rest
        if i < len(chords) - 1:
            c2 = chords[i+1]
        else:
            c2 = note.Rest()
        # If the root of the Chord is A, collect and display this Chord
        # and the next Chord (the last bit eliminates some passing 9th chords that can
        # be analyzed as having an A root)
        if c1.findRoot().name == 'A' and (c1.isTriad() is True or c1.isSeventh() is True):
            m = stream.Measure()
            m.append(c1)
            m.append(c2)
            display.append(m)    
    display.show()

Pitch and Duration Transformations
------------------------------------------------

This example creates a mensural canon from the Soprano part of a Bach chorale. The procedure extracts the :class:`~music21.note.Note` objects from the parsed :class:`~music21.stream.Score` object, using the :func:`~music21.corpus.base.parseWork` function and the :meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.getElementById` method. Then, a new part Stream is created by first scaling the timing and duration of events with the :meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.augmentOrDiminish` method and then transposing the pitches with the :meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.transpose` method. The modified Stream is then inserted into another Stream and displayed with the :meth:`~music21.base.Music21Object.show` method::


    from music21 import *
    src = corpus.parseWork('bach/bwv323.xml')
    ex = src.getElementById('Soprano').flat.notesAndRests
    
    s = stream.Score()
    for scalar, t in [(1, 'p1'), (2, 'p-5'), (.5, 'p-11'), (1.5, -24)]:
        part = ex.augmentOrDiminish(scalar, inPlace=False)
        part.transpose(t, inPlace=True)
        s.insert(0, part)
    s.show()

Basic Counting of and Searching for Musical Elements
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Here, we load a file and count the number of G#'s in it::

    from music21 import *
    s = corpus.parseWork("bach/bwv30.6")    
    # The `pitches` property will get all Pitch objects from all contained
    # Streams and Stream subclasses recursively 
    total = 0
    for p in s.pitches:
        if p.name == 'G#':
            total += 1
    print total # returns 28


2. This example searches a Part for a particular chord formation, a dominant seventh, expressed melodically::

    # First, we parse the score and get just the Violin part
    op133 = corpus.parseWork('beethoven/opus133.xml') 
    violin2 = op133.getElementById('2nd Violin')        
    # An empty container is created for later display
    display = stream.Stream() 
    # We iterate over each measure
    for m in violin2.getElementsByClass('Measure'):
        # We get a list of consecutive notes, skipping unisons, octaves,
        # and rests 
        notes = m.findConsecutiveNotes(skipUnisons=True, 
                skipOctaves=True, skipRests=True, noNone=True )
        # From this collection of Notes we gather all Pitches
        pitches = stream.Stream(notes).pitches
        # Taking four Pitches at a time, we create Chords            
        for i in range(len(pitches) - 3):
            c = chord.Chord(pitches[i:i+4])           
            c.duration.type = "whole"                 
            # We test to see if this Chord is a Dominant seventh
            if c.isDominantSeventh():
                # We label the Chord and the first Note of the Measure
                c.lyric = "m. " + str(m.number)
                primeForm = chord.Chord(m.pitches).primeFormString
                firstNote = m.notesAndRests[0]
                firstNote.lyric = primeForm
                # The chord (in closed position) and the Measures are 
                # appended for display 
                mChord = stream.Measure()
                mChord.append(c.closedPosition())
                display.append(mChord)
                display.append(m)
        
    display.show()
