Overview: Pitches, Durations, Notes, and Chords
=======================================================

For represented notated music, the :class:`~music21.note.Note` object is a critical tool. Note and :class:`~music21.chord.Chord` objects are both subclasses of :class:`~music21.base.Music21Object`, and share many features. Both are built, in part, from :class:`~music21.pitch.Pitch` and :class:`~music21.duration.Duration` objects.

This overview will illustrate key features of music21's Pitch, Duration, Note, and Chord objects. For complete documentation of these objects, see :ref:`modulePitch`, :ref:`moduleDuration`, :ref:`moduleNote`, and :ref:`moduleChord`.




Creating and Editing Pitches
----------------------------------

To create a Pitch object, simply call the class with a note name. A name (such as *B*) can be provided with optional symbols for sharp or flat (*#* or *-* respectively). An octave designation can optionally be provided (where middle C is C4).

>>> from music21 import *
>>> p1 = pitch.Pitch('b-4')

There are numerous ways of expressing pitch. Many are available as properties from the Pitch object. The following example demonstrates many of these properties. 

>>> p1.octave
4
>>> p1.pitchClass
10
>>> p1.name
'B-'
>>> p1.nameWithOctave
'B-4'
>>> p1.midi
70

Some of these parameters are settable. By setting a parameter in the appropriate format, the Pitch object is changed to reflect the new value. 

>>> p1.name = 'd#'
>>> p1.octave = 3
>>> p1
D#3

Accidentals are represented with an :class:`~music21.pitch.Accidental` object on the :attr:`~music21.pitch.Pitch.accidental` attribute of Pitch.

>>> p1.accidental
<accidental sharp>
>>> p1.accidental.alter
1.0

Pitches, like many objects, can be transposed by an interval specified in any format permitted by the :class:`~music21.interval.Interval` object. Common string presentation are acceptable. The :meth:`~music21.pitch.Pitch.transpose` method returns a new Pitch object, leaving the original unchanged. 

>>> p2 = p1.transpose('M7')
>>> p2
C##4

As with nearly all music21 objects, we can call the :class:`~music21.base.Music21Object.show` method to display this Pitch in notation.

>>> p1.show()  # doctest: +SKIP

Creating and Editing Durations
----------------------------------

Duration objects are ubiquitous in music21. Nearly all objects have, or can have, a Duration. A Duration can represent any time span, either quantized to common whole number ratios or otherwise. A Duration may represent a single notated entity (such as dotted quarter note) or tied aggregation of durations (such as a half note tied to a sixteenth note).

To create Duration, call the class with an optional duration value, expressed either as a string (such as "quarter" or "half") or with a number (a value in Quarter Lengths). The following example creates a half note duration and a dotted quarter note duration. 

>>> from music21 import *
>>> d1 = duration.Duration('half')
>>> d2 = duration.Duration(1.5)

As with pitch, there are many ways of expressing duration. Many are available as properties from the Duration object. The :attr:`~music21.duration.Duration.quarterLength` property expresses the duration in Quarter Lengths, a common unit throughout music21. The following example demonstrates many of these properties. 

>>> d1.quarterLength
2.0
>>> d2.dots
1
>>> d2.type
'quarter'
>>> d2.quarterLength
1.5

Some of the Duration parameters are settable. In the following example the :attr:`~music21.duration.Duration.quarterLength` property is set to a new value. All corresponding parameters are updated when necessary. While any floating point number can be used to set the quarter length, using the most accurate values for fractions is desirable. Note that in Python 2.x integer division results in integers; setting a `quarterLength` property to 1/3 will result in a 0, while 1/3.0 will result in a triplet (0.33333333333333331).

>>> d1.quarterLength = 2.25
>>> d1.type
'complex'

The :class:`~music21.base.Music21Object.show` method can be used to display the Duration with a default pitch value. 

>>> d1.show()    # doctest: +SKIP

Creating and Editing Notes
---------------------------

Note objects contain, as key components, a Pitch and a Duration instance. Notes contain additional parameters and functionality. We can create a Note in the same way we do a Pitch, by providing an initial Pitch value.

>>> from music21 import note
>>> n1 = note.Note('e-5')

Numerous Pitch and Duration attributes are made available as attributes of Note. For example:

>>> n1.name
'E-'
>>> n1.pitchClass
3
>>> n1.midi
75
>>> n1.quarterLength
1.0


Notes can store numerous lines of text as lyrics or other notations on the :attr:`~music21.note.Note.lyric` property. While this value can be set directly, the :meth:`~music21.note.GeneralNote.addLyric` method permits adding multiple notations to a single Note sequential;y. In the following example three Note attributes are added to the Note as annotations.

>>> n1.addLyric(n1.name)
>>> n1.addLyric(n1.pitchClass)
>>> n1.addLyric('QL: %s' % n1.quarterLength)

As should be clear, we can always check our work with the :class:`~music21.base.Music21Object.show` method.

>>> n1.show()    # doctest: +SKIP

.. image:: images/overviewNotes-03.*

As with the Duration object, we can edit the 
:attr:`~music21.note.Note.quarterLength` property to quickly change the 
Note's Duration. Notice that because we already set the lyric to have the
previous QL of 1.0, it does not get changed in the following example.

>>> n1.quarterLength = 6.25
>>> n1.show()   # doctest: +SKIP

.. image:: images/overviewNotes-04.*
    :width: 600


As is clear, a Note may be tied to another. If so, a :class:`~music21.note.Tie` object will be found on the :attr:`~music21.note.Note.tie` attribute. 




Creating and Editing Chords
------------------------------

Note and Chord objects, as both subclasses of the :class:`~music21.note.GeneralNote` object, share many features. Both contain a Duration object. A Note has only one Pitch; a Chord, however, contains a list one or more Pitch objects accessed via the :attr:`~music21.chord.Chord.pitches` property. The Chord object additional has numerous analytic methods (such as :meth:`~music21.chord.Chord.isDiminishedSeventh`) as well as a variety of post-tonal tools (such as :attr:`~music21.chord.Chord.forteClass`; see :ref:`overviewPostTonal`).

A Chord can be created with a list of Pitch objects or strings identical to those used for creating Pitches. Additional, pitch class integers can be provided. 

>>> from music21 import *
>>> c1 = chord.Chord(['a#3', 'g4', 'f#5'])
>>> c1.pitches
[A#3, G4, F#5]

Like with a Note, Duration object properties can be configured from properties on Chord. For example, the Quarter Length of the Chord can be accessed from the :attr:`~music21.chord.Chord.quarterLength` property. (Note that, to get expected results in Python 2.x, one of the values in division must be a floating point value.) The :meth:`~music21.base.Music21Object.show` method can be used to display the results.

>>> c1.quarterLength = 1 + 1/3.0
>>> c1.show()   # doctest: +SKIP

.. image:: images/overviewNotes-05.*
    :width: 600
    

A Chord, like a Note and Pitch, can be transposed by an interval specified in any format permitted by the :class:`~music21.interval.Interval` object. The :meth:`~music21.chord.Chord.transpose` method returns a new Chord instance. 

>>> c2 = c1.transpose('m2')
>>> c2.show()   # doctest: +SKIP

Finally, a Chord, like a Note, can have one or more lyrics. The :meth:`~music21.note.GeneralNote.addLyric` method functions the same as it does for Note. In the following example, a text annotation of the Forte set class name is added to the Chord.


>>> c2.addLyric(c2.forteClass)
>>> c2.show()     # doctest: +SKIP
